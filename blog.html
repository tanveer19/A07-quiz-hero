        Q1. Difference between map, filter , forEach , find.
      </h1>
      <p class="mt-6 mb-4 px-2 text-xl font-light leading-relaxed bg-sky-300">
        These are array methods to do operations on elements. Map creates a new
        array as the same size of original array by calling a function. Filter
        also creates a new array by some filtering based on a condition. forEach
        doesn't create a new array but executes a provided function for each
        element. Find gives the first element in the array which meets the given
        condition

        Q2. Difference between localstorage, sessionstorage, cookies.
      </h1>
      <p class="mt-6 mb-4 px-2 text-xl font-light leading-relaxed bg-sky-300">
        by using localstorage we can keep key-value pairs in the browser which
        will stay even if browser is closed. data has no expiration date.
        sessionstorage keeps data for the current session only. once the user
        closes tab, data gets deleted. cookies are small text files which are
        kept in user's device by the browser. they are used to store user
        choices or login info. it can have an expiration date.

        Q3. event loop
      </h1>
      <p class="mt-6 mb-4 px-2 text-xl font-light leading-relaxed bg-sky-300">
        The runtime model of JavaScript is based on an event loop, which
        executes the code, gathers and processes events, and performs queued
        sub-tasks. All the actions waiting in line to be carried out are tracked
        by the call stack. As soon as a function is complete, it is removed from
        the stack. New functions are sent to the stack for processing by the
        event queue. To maintain the correct order in which all operations
        should be transmitted for execution, it adheres to the queue data
        structure.
